However, accretion from such income will be clubbed with the income of parent of such minor.\n\nIncome of minor will be clubbed with the income of that parent whose income (excluding minor's income) is higher.\n\nIf the marriage of parents does not sustain, then minor's income will be clubbed with the income of parent who maintains the minor.\n\nIn case the income of individual includes income of his/her minor child, such individual can claim an exemption under section 10(32)) of Rs. 1,500 or income of minor so clubbed, whichever is less.\n\n(*) Provisions of section 64(1A) will not apply to any income of a minor child suffering from disability specified under section 80U.

In this case, Mrs. Raja is not having any income and, hence, if any income is to be clubbed then it will be clubbed with the income of Mr. Raja.\n\nIncome of minor child earned on account of manual work or income from the skill, knowledge, talent, experience, etc., of minor child will not be clubbed with the income of his/her parent. Thus, income of A from stage show will not be clubbed with the income of Mr. Raja but income of A from bank interest of Rs. 6,000 will be clubbed with the income of Mr. Raja.\n\nIncome of a minor suffering from disability specified under section 80U​ will not be clubbed with the income of his/her parent. Hence, any income of B will not be clubbed with the income of Mr. Raja.\n\nThe taxpayer can claim an exemption under section 10(32)). Thus, in respect of interest income of Rs. 6,000 clubbed in the income of Mr. Raja, he will be entitled to claim exemption of Rs. 1,500 under section 10(32)), hence, net income to be clubbed will be Rs. 4,500 (i.e., Rs. 6,000 – Rs. 1,500). ​ Deductee files a declaration with the dedu​ctor and the deductor reports the tax deduction in the name of the other person in the information relating to deduction of tax referred to in sub-rule (1) of rule 37BA​.​"

    "guidance": "PLACEHOLDER: Write plain-language guidance here",
    "source": "Here's how the Indian legal system typically distinguishes between these offenses:\n\nSexual Harassment: Sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature that creates a hostile or offensive work or educational environment. It can occur in various settings including workplaces, educational institutions, and public spaces. Sexual harassment is often a form of gender-based discrimination and can involve behavior such as unwanted touching, comments, gestures, or displays of sexually explicit material.\n\nIn India, sexual harassment is primarily addressed under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act, 2013. This law provides a framework for preventing and redressing cases of sexual harassment in the workplace and mandates the establishment of internal complaints committees in organizations to address complaints of sexual harassment.\n\nAssault with Intent to Outrage Modesty: Assault with the intent to outrage the modesty of a woman is defined under Section 354 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). This offense involves assaulting or using criminal force against a woman with the intent to outrage her modesty. The term \"modesty\" in this context generally refers to a woman's sense of decency or propriety.\n\nUnlike sexual harassment, which may not involve physical contact or may occur in non-physical settings, assault with the intent to outrage modesty typically involves physical actions such as touching, groping, or making sexually explicit gestures towards a woman without her consent. The key element of this offense is the intention of the perpetrator to outrage the modesty of the woman.\n\nThe punishment for this offense may include imprisonment, a fine, or both, as prescribed under the IPC."
