# ⚖️ NyaayaBot — The Indian Tenancy Law Assistant

**NyaayaBot** is a smart AI-powered chatbot built to assist users with **tenant–landlord disputes and rental law guidance in India**.  
It uses **Google Gemini API** for reasoning and natural language understanding, and **Gradio** for a simple and elegant chat-based interface.  

This project was developed by **Eshaan Singla**, a 3rd-year CSE student at **Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, Patiala**, as a practical and socially impactful application of AI in law and governance.

## 🧠 Overview

Tenancy disputes in India often confuse both tenants and landlords due to vague communication and complex legal jargon.  
**NyaayaBot** bridges this gap by acting as a conversational legal guide — offering explanations, summaries, and actionable steps based on Indian tenancy laws.

You can:
- 💬 Ask questions about rent, eviction, lease, deposits, or tenant rights.
- 📄 Upload rent agreements or legal notices in **PDF format** for analysis.
- ⚖️ Receive responses grounded in **Indian tenancy/rental clauses**.
- 🚫 Get polite refusals for non-tenancy topics (bot strictly focuses on this domain).
